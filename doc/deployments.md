# Deployments

For advanced usage read [this](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp#list_project_versions) documentation.

To see deployed versions:

To configure Google App Script to run a deployed version:

This allows to run multiple instances (deployments) at the same time, for example, its possible to run two or more deployments after completing one form.
